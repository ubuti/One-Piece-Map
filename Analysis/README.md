The class graph analysis can be used as an extension of the emoatlas 
library producing FormaMentis networks - a text based cognitive network. 
They are fed into the graph analysis creating the network and extracting 
graph properties as instance attributes. The emoatlas library found here 
https://pypi.org/project/emoatlas/ should be installed with the command 
`pip install --upgrade 
--extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ emoatlas` until further 
notice.
